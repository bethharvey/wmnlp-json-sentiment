"5 ContributorsSpaceman Lyrics[Verse 1]\nCity runnin' through my veins\nLike tiny bubbles in a champagne glass\nMake a body levitate\nWay, way, way up high, way, way up high\nThere's a party in my brain\nEvery color of the rainbow sky\nLine of Skittles on a plate\nWay, way, way up high\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nFeelin' like a spaceman under the stars\nLivin' in a wasteland somewhere on Mars\nSendin' out an SOS in the dark\nBut I got no service, no service\n\n[Chorus]\nOn and on, you can find me in the clouds now\nOn and on, if you think we're comin' down now\nDream on, dream on\nPop that lemonade, cola, soda\nTurn that record over, goin'\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nDream on, dream on\nPop that lemonade, cola, soda\nTurn that record over\nYou might also like[Verse 2]\nFriday knockin' at my door\nDodgin' Mondays like a matador\nHundred miles up the floor\nWay, way, way up high\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nFeelin' like a spaceman under the stars\nLivin' in a wasteland somewhere on Mars\nSendin' out an SOS in the dark\nBut I got no service, no service\n\n[Chorus]\nOn and on, you can find me in the clouds now\nOn and on, if you think we're comin' down now\nDream on, dream on\nPop that lemonade, cola, soda\nTurn that record over, goin'\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nDream on, dream on\nPop that lemonade, cola, soda\nTurn that record over\n\n[Bridge]\nNa-na-na-na-na\nNa-na-na-na-na\nNa-na-na-na-na-na (Dream on)\nNa-na-na-na-na\nNa-na-na-na-na\nNa-na-na-na-na-na (Dream on)\n[Chorus]\nOn and on, you can find me in the clouds now\nOn and on, if you think we're comin' down now\nDream on, dream on\nPop that lemonade, cola, soda\nTurn that record over, goin'\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nDream on, dream on\nPop that lemonade, cola, soda\nTurn that record overEmbed"
