As the title, Way Less Sad, implies, it's about starting to feel better after feeling sad or depressed for an extended period of time. Part of the chorus is the phrase \"I'm not happy yet, but I'm way less sad.\" It's a hopeful, but realistic message that someone's mood doesn't turn around immediately, but progress is still good. Also, the score is still close to 0, which indicates that it's not that negative."

It's not portrayed in a negative or self-obsessed way, it's more like someone is talking about a trait of someone they care about. It's a fun song (in my opinion) with positive lyrics, and I think that's reflected accurately by this score."
