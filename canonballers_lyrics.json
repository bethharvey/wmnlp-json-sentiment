"4 ContributorsCannonballers Lyrics[Verse 1]\nPulled behind a car with one hundred different bumper stickers on\nIn the left lane, crawling fifty-eight on the freeway\nEar's a ringing keychain, pressure in the blood\nCan't slow down, I'm a time bomb ticking while I run\nWith a loaded gun staring at the sun\nGot a blind eye, never hit the bullseye\nJust like acting tough\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAnd I keep asking myself\n\"Hey, why are you running?\"\n\n[Chorus]\nHardtop Impala, blank checks and Cannonballers\nHeard the whistle blow fom the Wabash\nCan't borrow time with the cold cash\nLa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la (With the cold cash)\nLa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la\n\n[Verse 2]\nTelevision preacher, got yourself another seeker on the line\nCould you make the time? I could use divine intervention\nUndivided attention, someone needs to know\nYeah, I cooked the books and threw my combinations\nDodging jabs and hooks with shallow conversations\nLike a surface level, speed sick devil on the loose\nSee Colony House LiveGet tickets as low as $31You might also like[Pre-Chorus]\nAnd I keep asking myself\n\"Hey, why are you running?\"\n\n[Chorus]\nHardtop Impala, blank checks and Cannonballers\nHeard the whistle blow fom the Wabash\nCan't borrow time with the cold cash\nLa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la (With the cold cash)\nLa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la\nLa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la\nLa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la (But I keep on running)\nHardtop Impala, blank checks and Cannonballers\nHeard the whistle blow fom the Wabash\nCan't borrow time with the cold cash\nLa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la (Can't borrow time with the cold cash)\nLa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la\n\n[Outro]\nAnd I keep asking myself\n\"Hey, what are you running from?\"\nDon't know why I keep runningEmbed"
